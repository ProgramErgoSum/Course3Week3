There is no easy way of saying it and so here it is.

Instead of uploading the tidy data, I uploaded the averages data.

Considering the effort and (I admit!) fun involved in doing this, I am very annoyed with myself for doing this. I will leave it to the peers to do the 'right thing' here.

This is how my tidy data looks like:

nsubrahm@ubuntu-vm:~/data$ head -10 tidydata.txt
"subjectId" "featureName" "featureValue" "activityLabel"
18 "tBodyAccJerk.entropy.X" 0.6987987 "WALKING"
9 "tBodyAcc.min.Z" 0.16261417 "WALKING"
2 "tBodyGyro.arCoeff.Y_4" 0.23984334 "WALKING"
13 "fBodyAcc.bandsEnergy.1_8" -0.81651406 "WALKING"
24 "fBodyAccJerk.min.X" -0.7330406 "WALKING"
2 "tGravityAcc.arCoeff.Y_1" 0.35468434 "WALKING"
2 "tGravityAcc.arCoeff.Y_2" -0.34609972 "WALKING"
9 "tBodyAccMag.max" -0.20583055 "WALKING"
2 "fBodyGyro.max.Y" -0.68399448 "WALKING"
